# MultiModelCNN

There are three branches in the proposed multi-model deep CNN network:
1. A modified version of VGG-16 for Sentinel-2 data
2. A 3D CNN for Sentinel-1 data
3. The Swin Transformer for the DEM generated from LiDAR data

Here are the codes for the "Swin Transformer and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Coastal Wetland Classification using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR Data" paper.


**In our VGG-16 network, we modified the number of filters and kernel sizes to reduce the complexity of the original VGG-16 Deep CNN Network**


The paper is under review in Remote Sensing journal.
