There are three branches in the proposed multi-model deep CNN network:
1. A modified version of VGG-16 for Sentinel-2 data
2. A 3D CNN for Sentinel-1 data
3. The Swin Transformer for the DEM generated from LiDAR data


**In our VGG-16 network, we modified the number of filters and kernel sizes to reduce the complexity of the original VGG-16 Deep CNN Network**
